# from-bpmn-to-datamodel

## Get Started

### 1. System Requirements

- Globally installed [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
  (e.g. `apt-get install graphviz`)
- Or make sure that 'dot' is available in your environment path

### 2. Installation

On the command prompt run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CarolinGoerke/from-bpmn-to-datamodel.git
```

### 3. Run

```sh
$ python3 translate.py outfile infile [infile2 ...]
```

`outfile` is the name of a PNG file. The file extension is added if not specified. If a file with this name already exists, it will be overwritten. The output file contains the class diagram, which is derived from `infile`. The file specified in `infile` must be an XML file containing a BMPN diagram with the schema http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL. If multiple input files are specified, the output file contains a merged class diagram in one image file. The program is tested with files generated by bpmn.io (Camunda).

## Technologies & Packages

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
- [Camunda](https://camunda.com/)

## Examples

In the examples folder there are several example BPMN processes. 

For example, a class diagram can be created for the process Treatment.bpmn with the following command:

```sh
$ python3 translate.py Treatment.png examples/Treatment.bpmn
```
